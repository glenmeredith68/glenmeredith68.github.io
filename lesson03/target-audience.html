        <h2>Site Target Audience</h2>
        <p>The target audience for this site is people that live in and around Medway who are
            interested in fishing or want to become interested in fishing and want to know more
            about the Medway fishing scene.</p>
        <h2>Personas</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>The first persona is someone like myself. I am pretty new to the fishing scene, and
                I don't know a whole lot about it. I know the basics, but I could use a little more
                help in the way of tips. I have lived in Medway all my life, but I have no idea
                where I can fish around here. I come to the site wondering, where can I fish, and
                what weather is best for fishing? </li>
            <li>The second persona is someone who is more experienced at fishing. They have lots of
                fishing under their belt, but perhaps are new to the area or simply looking for a
                new spot to try when casting their line. They probably don't need any tips, but they
                can submit tips of their own an check out the maps and pictures to see where they
                want to go. The weather forecast provided will help them to make the best judgment
                on whether or not today is a good day to fish.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Scenarios</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>A new fisher comes to the site wondering what he can do to up his or her fishing
                game to the next level and finds tips to help themself.</li>
            <li>An experienced fisher fomes to the site wondering what are the conditions such as
                cloud cover and wind speed so that they can make the best call on whether or not
                today might be a successful fishing day.</li>
            <li>A fisher from out of town visits the site wondering where the fishing hotspots are
                and comes away knowing where they want to fish that day or in the future.</li>
            <li>Someone from outside of Medway who is considering visiting in the future comes to
                the site for research to find out what there is to do in Medway. They learn about
                the excitement of fishing and feel it in the Gallery pictures. They are more
                interested in coming to Medway because of what they see and feel.</li>
            <li>A fisher of any level comes to the site to find out what the record sizes and
