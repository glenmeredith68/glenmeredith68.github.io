                <h3>White Space and Clean Design</h3>

            <p>Medium.com uses white space and clean design in a powerful way. The whitespace around
                the
                text makes it easy and relaxing to find where the important things on the page are
                like
                words and buttons. I especially like this example as it shows that white space can
                be
                other colors too. There is clean design here closely related to the white space.
                Since
                there is ample white space, the design feels clean and not cluttered or distressing
                to
                look at. I feel good when I look at this page.</p>

                <h3>Contrast</h3>

            <img src="../images/tacoBell.jpg" alt="Tacobell.com home page screenshot">
            <p>Tacobell.com uses contrast here to draw your attention to the fact that they are
                hiring.
                The white is very contrasted with the dark purple so that there is a clear attention
                grab and break in the action on the page. It is clear that they are not talking
                about
                the Crunchwrap Supreme and have moved on to talking about hiring. The contrast isn't
                too
                harsh to look at, but isn't too subtle to notice.</p>

            <img src="../images/smores.jpg" alt="Wikihow.com page about smores screenshot">
            <p>Wikihow.com makes good use of repetition. All the typography is consistent
                throughout,
                and the images are the same size and style so that it is easy for the viewre to
                anticipate where the information will be and how to find it. The colors are
                sonsistent
                with their various elements so it is pleasing to the eye. The use of numbers also
                helps
                the viewer through the use of repetition.</p>
